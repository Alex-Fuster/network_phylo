  ## **1. Initialization Phase**
  - **Set seed for reproducibility**
  - **Generate basal species traits:**  
  - Draw random basal species niche values \( n \) from uniform distribution \([0, 0.005]\).
- **Generate the first species:**  
  - Traits are initialized randomly using `rand_traits_anc(pars)`, including:
  - \( n \): niche position
- \( r \): niche range
- \( o \): optimum trait value.
- **Initialize presence-absence matrix:**  
  - The first species is set to present in the matrix.
- **Set up ancestry tracking and phylogenetic distance matrix:**  
  - Track ancestor-descendant relationships and distances over time.
- **Initialize interaction matrices:**  
  - Track species interactions across time steps.

---
  
  ## **2. Main Evolutionary Loop (For each timestep)**
  
  ### **Step 1: Update species presence and ancestry**
  - Iterate over present species:
  - Track living species and update their ancestry distance.

### **Step 2: Speciation Process**
- **Probability of speciation:**  
  \[
    P_{\text{speciation}} = \frac{u_{\max}}{1 + e^{d (S_{\text{actual}} - I_{\max})}}
    \]
- Randomly decide if speciation occurs based on this probability.
- **Trait mutation:**  
  - Generate mutant species traits using `rand_traits_mut()` function.
- Direction of mutation: "greater" or "lesser" niche value.

### **Step 3: Establishment of the mutant species**
- Compute number of interactions for the mutant:  
  \[
    \text{sum}_I = \sum L
    \]
- Calculate **establishment probability:**  
  \[
    P_{\text{estab}} = SN \cdot P_{\text{neutral}} + (1 - SN) \cdot P_{\text{selected}}
    \]
- If successful, the new species is added.
- If niche overlap is minimal, ancestor may go extinct.

---
  
  ## **3. Interaction Matrix Construction**
  - Using the function `get_L_mat()` to create a species interaction matrix based on:
  - **Niche overlap conditions:**  
  - Lower and upper niche boundaries:  
  \[
    \text{Low} = o - r, \quad \text{High} = o + r
    \]
- **Gaussian probability function:**  
  \[
    P_{\text{interaction}} = \exp\left(-\frac{(\text{distance})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
    \]
- **Predation penalty for prey with higher niche values.**
  - **Binomial probability draw** to determine interactions.

---
  
  ## **4. Extinction Process**
  - Compute interaction matrix for all species.
- Calculate extinction probability based on:
  - **Outgoing interaction sums:**  
  \[
    P_{\text{ext, top-down}} = e_{0_{\text{neg}}} + e_{1_{\text{neg}}} (1 - e^{-a_{\text{neg}}} \cdot \text{out}_I)
    \]
- **Competition-based extinction probability:**  
  \[
    P_{\text{ext, comp}} = 1 - e^{-\alpha \cdot \text{similarity}}
    \]
- Combination of both:
  \[
    P_{\text{ext}} = \beta_{\text{ext}} \cdot P_{\text{ext, top-down}} + (1 - \beta_{\text{ext}}) \cdot P_{\text{ext, comp}}
    \]
- Species with no resources go extinct with probability = 1.

---
  
  ## **5. Recording and Stopping Conditions**
  - Record and update:
  - Presence matrix.
- Ancestry distances.
- Interaction matrices.
- Species guilds (herbivores, predators, omnivores).
- Stop simulation if species richness falls below a threshold (e.g., 3 species).

---
  
  ## **6. Output of the Simulation**
  The final output includes:
  
  - Species presence over time.
- Trait evolution.
- Interaction matrices for each timestep.
- Phylogenetic ancestry.
- Guild classification of species.

### Probability of Establishment

The probability of establishment is given by the equation:

\[
P_{\text{establishment}} = SN \cdot P_{\text{neutral}} + (1 - SN) \cdot P_{\text{selective}}
\]

where:

- \( SN \) is the weight given to stochastic versus selective establishment.
- \( P_{\text{neutral}} \) represents the neutral establishment probability.
- \( P_{\text{selective}} \) is calculated as:

\[
P_{\text{selective}} = u_{0\text{pos}} + u_{1\text{pos}} \cdot e^{-a_{\text{upos}} \cdot I}
\]

where:

- \( u_{0\text{pos}} \) is the baseline probability of establishment.
- \( u_{1\text{pos}} \) is the maximum probability contribution from interactions.
- \( a_{\text{upos}} \) is the sensitivity parameter for interactions.
- \( I \) is the number of interactions with existing species.
\]
